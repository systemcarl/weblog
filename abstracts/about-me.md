# On the Grounds That I Don't Know the Answer
Who am I? I'm Carl.

I'm a software developer, applied physicist, and purveyor of eclectic knowledge.
As a curious person, I have devoted much of my life to exploring enigmatic

In the process, I acquired a deep appreciation for science, technology,
    and questions that are not easily answered.
