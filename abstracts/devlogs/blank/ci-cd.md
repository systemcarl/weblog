# Exploring CI/CD for a Modern (SvelteKit) Web Application
I'm building a new SvelteKit web app to host my weblog.
To make it easier, I built a CI/CD pipeline (for the first time).
During research and development, I explored containerization, IaC, testing, and
    observability solutions
to learn how to best deliver a modern web app.
