# Hello World
Hello world! Welcome to my weblog.

Here you can find everything made by me, Carl Edward Lyons.
I commonly document my various projects and share ideas related to my work.
Most of the time, I am authoring and sharing code.
And when I am not busy re-inventing the wheel, you can likely find me pondering
    about scientific research and philosophy.
I generally devote my time to anything complex, challenging, or otherwise
    rarefied.
While I would not describe myself using any of those adjectives, you can learn
    more about me, my interests, and my history in my short
    [autobiographical article](./about-me.md).

I add to this collection of writing as new topics arise and time allows.
[Follow me](./about-me.md#keep-in-touch) to stay up to date with my latest work,
    or check my [article list](./articles) occasionally for updates.
