# Hello, World!
Welcome to my weblog!

This is my first post, and also an introduction to my weblog content collection.
I'm starting this weblog to share my interests, ideas, and knowledge.
You'll find a repertoire of my tips, guides, and other related insights
    about technology, science, and whatever else captures my curiosity.

## Committing to Open Development
In addition to posting all the code for my open projects to [GitHub],
I also document all my personal work with (semi-regular) development logs
    (DevLogs).
While also helping to reflect on my choices and document my progress,
these journals help to promote these project ideas to potential users or
    contributors.
I also hope to these articles provide some insight into the software development
    process for others with similar ambitions.
I do my best to go beyond simple tutorials about basic tools and programming
    skills,
focusing instead on intensional design and problem solving strategies.

While I continue to build out my weblog platform to make these easier to find
    (and document the process),
you can read the first few DevLogs I've written so far here:
- [Setting Up SvelteKit for a Personal Weblog]
- [Exploring CI/CD for a Modern (SvelteKit) Web Application]
- [Designing a Content Template]
- [Implementing a Weblog Markdown Parser]
