# Hello, World!
Welcome to my weblog!

This is my first post, and also an introduction to my weblog content collection.
I'm starting this weblog to share my interests, ideas, and knowledge.
You'll find a repertoire of my tips, guides, and other related insights 
    about technology, science, and whatever else captures my curiosity.

Come back here, or visit [my website], to see what's new.
I keep all my content up to date, including this article, with my current
    projects and new article topics.
You can find a list of changes to this article, or any of my other posts, on
    [GitHub].

Read [about me] to learn more about my professional background, philosophy, and ambitions. 
Also, [follow me] to stay up to date with my work.
