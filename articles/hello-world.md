# Hello, World!
Welcome to my weblog!

This is my first post, and also an introduction to my weblog content collection.
I'm starting this weblog to share my interests, ideas, and knowledge.
You'll find a repertoire of my tips, guides, and other related insights
    about technology, science, and whatever else captures my curiosity.

## Master of None
While I have no intention of describing myself as a leading expert in web
    development, physics, or behavioral science,
I am not afraid to share my thoughts and opinions where I feel qualified.
Having a diverse [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)]
    background,
I've made a career of learning new skills quickly and transferring expertise
    between disciplines.
Naturally, digging into new topics and obscure topics is a common occurrence
    in my line of work.

In my experience, anything worth learning is worth sharing.
So, I often take the extra time to write articles about anything I find that is
    not widely known or well documented.
These articles often include software development tips and guides,
such as a short tutorial for testing in Svelte 5 that I recently published:
- [Mocking Svelte 5 Components]

## Committing to Open Development
In addition to posting all the code for my open projects to [GitHub],
I also document all my personal work with (semi-regular) development logs
    (DevLogs).
While also helping to reflect on my choices and document my progress,
these journals help to promote these project ideas to potential users or
    contributors.
I also hope to these articles provide some insight into the software development
    process for others with similar ambitions.
I do my best to go beyond simple tutorials about basic tools and programming
    skills,
focusing instead on intensional design and problem solving strategies.

While I continue to build out my weblog platform to make these easier to find
    (and document the process),
you can read the first few DevLogs I've written so far here:
- [Setting Up SvelteKit for a Personal Weblog]
- [Exploring CI/CD for a Modern (SvelteKit) Web Application]
- [Designing a Content Template]
- [Implementing a Weblog Markdown Parser]
