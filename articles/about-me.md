# On the Grounds That I Don't Know the Answer
So, I'm Carl.

I can be many things, depending on when or how you find me. But without fail,
    I am always an unapologetic nerd.
I love science fiction,
from *Star Trek*'s naive mid-century techno-optimism
to *Jurassic Park*'s outlandish cautionary tale.
I also love games in any form, 
    but I'll take a creative tabletop role-playing game over an
    uninspired transaction-fuelled "AAA" any day.
I'm passionate about aesthetics, ethics, and morality;
I love discussing anything intellectually or philosophically challenging.

I feel the need to introduce myself, my work, and my ambitions to give context
    to my projects and other endeavours.
While I find it challenging to write about myself,
leaving my story here lets me share and connect with the
    online community.

# I Have Ended Up Where I Need to Be
I have loved science and computers for as long as I can remember.
My earliest memories involve an obsession with the Bill Nye the Science Guy show
and with trying tirelessly to bootstrap video games from my compact floppy disk
    collection.
These preoccupations, as well as a natural curiosity about how things work, have
    carried throughout my post-secondary education and professional career.
Now, I am primarily a software developer,
but I also see myself as a scientist and educator.

## I'd Rather Be Happy Than Right
I continued to pursue my interest in science through a diverse university
    education.
I first received a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree from the University of
    Waterloo, where I studied physics—a natural choice for someone fascinated by the fundamental workings of the
    universe.
More specifically, I specialized in astrophysics and took any course that focused on
    mathematical modelling and computer simulation.

Over the last few years, I have been gradually working towards a Master of
    Science (MSc) degree in psychology at McMaster University.
While I had always had a pet interest in psychology,
the Department of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour gave me an opportunity to
    dive deeper into statistical analysis, experimental design, and scientific
    writing.
I have applied this new knowledge in my MSc thesis studying the biophysics of vesper bat
    echolocation.
I have been working to document and understand the spatial characteristics of
    big brown bat (*Eptesicus fuscus*) developmental vocalizations
(the sounds bat pups make as they learn to echolocate).
The majority of my time has been spent developing computational signal analysis
    tools to extract data from the raw audio recordings.

## You Live and Learn
In tandem with my education, I have continued to pursue a professional career in
    technology,
where my love for computers has thrived.
After receiving my BSc, my career began in an electrical manufacturing support
    role bridging quality assurance, testing, technical sales, and incident
    management.
It was in this role, while troubleshooting and field repairing commercial-industrial control
    systems, that I realized my passion for systems design.

Pursuing this passion into the software development industry required
    significant amounts of determined effort.
Aside from the undergraduate simulation and modelling courses—which used
    Python and C++—
    my software and programming skills are self-taught.

I first practiced modding video games, writing small scripts to
    automate medial tasks, and free-lancing for friends and family.
Then, while building a website for my good friend Jerry's business,
I realized the potential of *the web*
and dove headfirst into a world of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, web servers, and web
    servers on top of web servers.
Since then, I have been doubling down on my long-standing love for Python for backend
    development to build web applications and services.

### I Love Deadlines
Over the last five years, I have been writing software and building web
    applications concurrently with my MSc studies.
The majority of this was focused on rebuilding the MRKTBOX e-commerce web
    application.
The project's goal was to create a multi-channel e-commerce application that
    intuitively handles whatever requirements a small business could throw at it: 
    cafe, catering, home delivery, and other special offerings.
The application comprised a custom back-end service
with a repurposed front-end from a pre-existing open-source project, OpenTender.

One of most valuable experiences of this project was working with local colleges
    to supervise co-op terms and student-led projects.
Getting to mentor and guide aspiring developers was an incredibly rewarding
    experience.
Endless hours lecturing on topics of best practice, reviewing code, and
    untangling git commits was an enlightening exercise in leadership and
    project management.

Since finishing my work on the MRKTBOX project, I have continued studying,
    researching, and experimenting;
primarily working on this weblog, here.
Aside from writing programming guides, professional tips, and other articles,
    I am also building the website, from the ground up.
The goal is to create a prototype for an open-source, modular, extensible, maybe
    federated, blogging service.
Essentially, this weblog is the current expression of my love for software
    design and development,
in the form of rambling development diaries, how-to guides, opinion pieces, and
    the code that props it all up.
Sharing the software and the process of creating it is my contribution to the
    long-form content ecosystem.

# It Has Great Practical Value
The many roles I've served, across academia and industry, have highlighted the
    vast amount of power that modern technologies can provide.
The last few decades have shown us amazing tools that can not only improve our
    day-to-day lives, but have the potential to advance us exponentially as a
    society.
However, even with the unfathomable amounts of computing power and data
    available today,
we still struggle to solve many problems that feel within reach.
There is still much to learn about our future — and ourselves — in order to
    satisfy all of our ambitions.

## See First, Think Later, Then Test
My personal goal is to apply what I've learned from scientific training to my
    professional work.
Namely, I've learned that researching any phenomenon requires correct scientific
    process.
The definition of scientific process is a method of inquiry that is systematic,
    empirical, and reproducible.
By this definition, it stands to reason that any approach to problem solving
    can (and probably should) follow scientific process;
product design and project management are no exception.
A scientific approach provides a reliable framework to find the best solution to
    an enigmatic problem.
I believe that harnessing this process will undoubtedly lead to better outcomes,
    grounded in evidence and reason.

## Let the Present Move Forward Into the Future
I'm also of the opinion software developers should always be thinking towards
    the future.
Sure — we all have to stay focused on the the milestone.
But any experienced project manager knows: if you don't consider our direction,
    you may just be [scrum] sprinting into a wall.
Personally, I want to create technology that will stand the test of time, either
    by being extensible or modular.
In this way, new software solutions can be applied to problems outside their
    originally intended domain.

This only highlights the importance of decentralized, open-source technology.
The tools we make cannot help anyone locked away until they have been
    sufficiently monetized.
Technology should be easily accessible to everyone.
Effective collaboration can only happen when the resources and information are
    available to be shared.
I can't think of a greater achievement than creating a foundational piece of
    work that paves the way for others to build.

## Grapple With the Ineffable
Though most of all, I also want to teach what I've learned.
Throughout completing my teaching assistantships, guest lectures, and
    supervision of college projects and co-op internships, my desire to educate
    has solidified.
I know I wouldn't be where I am without the mentorship and guidance I've
    received along the way,
and I want to provide the same for others.

One of the most important concepts I want to teach is that software innovation
    can only continue when new developers are trained with the fundamentals
    required to solve new problems.
Continuous research and investment into teaching computer programming will only
    become more important as technology continues to demand more from us in
    return.

Already, technology has become a necessary part of our lives.
However, differences in access to technology, "The Digital Divide", is a key
    factor in worsening inequity.
If we want a future free from oppression and classism, we have to remove
    socioeconomic barriers and fairly distribute resources.
Making software resources and tools freely available reduces the financial
    barrier for everyday use and careers in technology.
Thus, a future of equity requires working together and sharing knowledge of
    technology.
This weblog is my contribution to sharing knowledge and enabling others.

### At Any Rate, You Live
I have been told "[I] don't work very hard, but [I] work smart."
I want to share that gift with others, by:
- scientifically researching how to build educated solutions,
- building and sharing tools to manage complex and unintuitive problems,
- and teaching the skills so others can do the same.

In the end, I hope my efforts will contribute to scientific research,
    technological development, and education.
I can't fix all the problems in the world myself, but I can help others to in
    their work.
I will grow old realizing the future that classic science-fiction dreamed of, or
    die trying.

### Better to Talk to Than Nobody
