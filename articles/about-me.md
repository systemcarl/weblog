# About Me

*Ahoy!*

I am Carl Edward Lyons; technologist, scientist, and educator.
As little as I enjoy indulging in boastful self-promotion, I feel it may
    be necessary to provide a brief account of my career up to this point.
For those reading the rest of my writing, my experiences may provide context to
    my opinions and ideas.
My history may also give additional background to my projects and other
    endeavours.
If nothing else, I hope my story will serve as a personal introduction and a
    foundation for connecting with the online community.

## A Journey So Far
Science and technology have always been a beloved and integral part of my life.
Some of my earliest memories are of learning to boot the family computer into
    [Microsoft Digital Operating System (MS-DOS)] and load games from my
    compact floppy disk.
Beyond that, much of my childhood was spent watching syndicated PBS broadcasts
    including [Bill Nye the Science Guy] and [The Magic School Bus].
My fascination with the intricate workings of the work around me carried these
    interests through high school and university.
And now, well into adulthood, I still love exploring new concepts in science
    and technology, and incessantly sharing my discoveries with whoever will
    listen.

My time has often been split between professional work and endless ongoing
    education.
The majority of my professional experience has been either in the
    manufacturing or software industries.
However, between the two, I spent two years as a graduate student working
    towards a Master of Science (M.Sc.) studying Psychology.
In both industry and academia, I have been fortunate enough to be continually
    tasked with training and professional development.
Through this work, both learning new skills and passing learned skills on to
    others, I have seen the value of education first-hand again and again.

### Modern, Accessible Technology
I've now spent over 5 years writing software and building web applications.
I fell into web development quite naturally, and perhaps against my free will.
Over the course of my academic studies, I have only taken a few formal
    classes in Python, C++, and R.
It wasn't until a few years after graduating that it even occurred to me that
    a career in software development was an option.
And still, I was reluctant to learn about web applications;
not knowing anything about HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, I didn't understand what
    these fluid, largely chaotic technologies had to offer.
But, when someone finally convinced me to build them a website, I could not deny
    the power and accessibility of the web.

You can find my [portfolio] online, as part of my ongoing weblog.
There are several articles describing each project in detail.
I have included information for every intelligible piece of work that I have the
    freedom to share.
All of the applicable code is also available on [my GitHub profile].

Most notably, I architected, designed, and largely developed the [MRKTBOX
    e-commerce web application].
This project was initially conceived in late 2020, and I have worked on it
    off and on for the first 5 years of my software career.
The goal changed significantly over several iterations, but the end result was
    a multi-channel e-commerce application that intuitively supported the
    business' cafe, catering, home delivery, and other special offerings.
For reasons influenced largely by legacy, the solution consisted of a
    [re-written OpenTender front-end application] and our own custom back-end
    service.
I go into more detail about the [MRKTBOX project] in [my portfolio],
and the open-source front-end is still available in
    [MRKTBOX's GitHub repository]
