# On the Grounds That I Don't Know the Answer[^adams]
I'm Carl.

I sometimes find it difficult to describe exactly who I am.
But one thing I can say for certain: I'm a nerd.
I love science fiction,
from [*Star Trek*]'s naive mid-century techno-optimism
to [*Jurassic Park*]'s outlandish cautionary tale.
I also love games in any form,
but I'll take a simple, creative [tabletop role-playing game] over an
    uninspired transaction-fuelled ["AAA"] any day.
I'm passionate about [aesthetics], [ethics], and [morality];
I love discussing anything intellectually or philosophically challenging.

I'd like to introduce myself, my work, and my ambitions to give context
    to my projects and other endeavours.
While I find it challenging to write about myself,
hopefully leaving my story here will help me share and connect with the
    online community.

## I Have Ended Up Where I Need to Be
I have loved science and computers for as long as I can remember.
My earliest memories recount a mild obsession with [*Bill Nye the Science Guy*]
and tireless efforts to bootstrap video games from my [compact floppy disk]
    collection.
These preoccupations, as well as a natural curiosity about how things work, have
    carried throughout my post-secondary education and professional career.
Now, I am primarily a software developer,
but I also still see myself as a scientist and educator.

### I'd Far Rather Be Happy Than Right
I continued to pursue my interest in science through a diverse university
    education.
I first received a [Bachelor of Science (BSc)] degree from the
    [*University of Waterloo*], where I studied [physics] —
an intuitive choice for someone fascinated by the fundamental workings of the
    universe.
Naturally, I enrolled in any course that focused on mathematical modelling and
    computer simulation,
which led me to specialize in [astrophysics].

Over the last few years, I have been gradually working towards a [Master of
    Science (MSc)] degree in [psychology] at [*McMaster University*].
I have been studying and have assisted with undergraduate courses, completed
    teaching assistantships, and performed guest lectures.
While I had always had a pet interest in psychology,
the [*Department of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour*] gave me an
    opportunity to dive deeper into statistical analysis, experimental design,
    and scientific writing.
I applied this knowledge in my MSc thesis studying the biophysics of
    [vesper bat] [echolocation].
I have been working to document and understand the spatial characteristics of
    [big brown bat (*Eptesicus fuscus*)] developmental vocalizations
(the sounds bat pups make as they learn to echolocate).
This work might seem distant from programming or physics,
but the majority of my time has been spent developing computational signal
    analysis tools to extract acoustic data from the raw audio recordings.

### You Live and Learn
In tandem with my education, I have continued to pursue a professional career in
    technology,
where my love for computers has thrived.
After receiving my BSc, my career began in an electrical manufacturing support
    role
bridging quality assurance, testing, technical sales, and incident
    management.
It was in this role, while troubleshooting and field repairing
    commercial-industrial control systems, that I realized my passion for
    systems design.

Pursuing this passion into the software development industry required
    significant amounts of determined effort.
Aside from the undergraduate simulation and modelling courses — which used
    [*Python*] and [*C++*] —
my software and programming skills are self-taught.

While modding video games in my free time, I began writing small scripts to
    automate medial tasks, and free-lancing for friends and family.
Then, while building a website for my good friend [Jerry's business],
I realized the potential of [*the web*]
and dove headfirst into a world of [*HTML*], [*CSS*], [*JavaScript*],
    [web servers], and [web servers on top of web servers].
Since then, I have been busy building full-stack web applications and services.

#### I Love Deadlines
Over the last five years, I have been writing software and building web
    applications
concurrently with my MSc studies.
For most of this time, my task was to rebuild the [*MRKTBOX*]
    [e-commerce web application].
The goal of the project was to create a multi-channel e-commerce application
    that intuitively handles whatever customer experience a small business could
    throw at it:
cafe, catering, home delivery, and other special offerings.

One of the most valuable experiences of this project was supervising aspiring
    student developers from local colleges as they worked on co-op terms or
    industry partner projects.
Spending countless hours reviewing student code, untangling git commits, and
    lecturing on best practices
was an enlightening exercise in leadership and project management.

Since finishing my work on the *MRKTBOX* project, I have continued studying,
    researching, and experimenting,
which has culminated in the process of building this weblog, here.
My goal is to create a prototype for an open-source, modular, extensible, (maybe
    eventually) federated blogging service.
I am also writing programming guides, professional tips, and other articles
    to include on my weblog.
Essentially, this is the current expression of my love for software
    design and development,
in the form of development diaries, how-to guides, opinion pieces, and
    the code that props it all up.
Sharing the software and the software's development process is my attempt to add
    to the long-form content software ecosystem.

## It Has Great Practical Value
Across my many roles in academia and industry, I've learned the vast amount of
    power that modern technologies can provide.
Development over the last few decades has led to amazing tools that can not only
    improve our day-to-day lives, but that have the potential to advance us
    exponentially as a society.
However, even with the unfathomable amount of computing power and data available
    today,
we still struggle to solve many important problems that seem within reach.

I don't believe that technology itself is ever the root problem.
Instead, I believe that certain applications of technology are the problem.
For example, vast amounts of our economic and social infrastructure rely on
    centralized services.
The corporations responsible for operating these services have continually
    proven incapable of self-moderation
    and are plagued by misaligned incentives.
Increased demand for computing power now necessitates a dependence on privatized
    infrastructure.
Unless we find ways to address these concerns, our future will only become more
    contingent on these unreliable resources as our needs continue to grow.

Luckily, there have been software developers working to embrace technology
    to help solve these problems without compromising our safety and security.
Federated systems are already making social platforms, like [*Mastodon*], more
    autonomous and democratic;
local-first architecture is now giving users more control over their data.
But as it stands, there is still much to learn in order to satisfy all of our
    ambitions without unintended consequences.

### See First, Think Later, Then Test
My personal goal is to apply what I've learned from scientific training to my
    professional work.
Namely, I've learned that researching any phenomenon requires correct scientific
    process.
The definition of scientific process is a method of inquiry that is systematic,
    empirical, and reproducible.
By this definition, it stands to reason that any approach to problem solving
    can (and probably should) follow scientific process;
product design and project management are no exception.
A scientific approach provides a reliable framework to find the best solution to
    an enigmatic problem.
I believe that harnessing this process will undoubtedly lead to better outcomes,
    grounded in evidence and reason, for the benefit of all.

### Let the Present Move Forward Into the Future
I'm also of the opinion software developers should always be thinking towards
    the future.
Sure, we all have to stay focused on the next milestone.
But any experienced project manager knows: if you don't consider your direction,
    you may just be [[scrum]] sprinting into a wall.

Personally, I want to create technology that will stand the test of time,
either by being extensible or modular.
In this way, new software solutions can be applied to problems outside their
    originally intended domain.
I can't think of a greater achievement than creating a foundational piece of
    work that paves the way for others to build.

### Grapple With the Ineffable
Though, most of all, I also want to teach what I've learned.
Throughout teaching assistantships, guest lectures, and supervision of college
    projects and co-op internships, my desire to educate
    has solidified.
I know I wouldn't be where I am without the mentorship and guidance I've
    received along the way,
and I want to provide the same for others.

One of the most important concepts I want to teach is that software innovation
    can only continue when new developers are trained with the fundamentals
    required to solve new problems.
Continuous research and investment into teaching computer programming will only
    become more important as technology continues to demand more from us in
    return.

Already, technology has become a necessary part of our lives.
However, differences in access to technology, ["The Digital Divide"], is a key
    factor in worsening inequity.
If we want a future free from oppression and classism, we have to remove
    socioeconomic barriers and fairly distribute resources.
Making software resources and tools freely available reduces the financial
    barrier for everyday use and careers in technology.
Thus, a future of equity requires working together and sharing knowledge of
    technology.
This weblog is my contribution to sharing knowledge and enabling others.

## At Any Rate, You Live
I have been told "[I] don't work very hard, but [I] work smart."
I want to share that gift with others, by:
- scientifically researching how to build educated solutions,
- building and sharing tools to manage complex and unintuitive problems,
- and teaching the skills so others can do the same.

In the end, I hope my efforts will contribute to scientific research,
    technological development, and education.
I can't fix all the problems in the world myself, but I can help others to in
    their work.
If I don't live to see a classic science-fiction future,
    I'll have died trying.
