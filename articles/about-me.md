# About Me
My name is Carl Edward Lyons. I am an unapologetic nerd.
I love classic science fiction such as Star Trek (The Original Series) and
Jurassic Park. I also love games in any form, especially if they are
    inspirational or creative like Dungeons and Dragons.
I love discussions about aesthetics, ethics, and morality — essentially anything
    intellectually or philosophically challenging.

I'm writing this short autobiography to introduce myself, my career, and my
    future goals.
While I find it challenging to write about myself, this article serves as a
    personal introduction to my projects, provides context for my other
    articles, and connects me with the online community.
I hope you enjoy.

# I Have Ended Up Where I Need to Be
I have always loved science and computers; as a young child I watched shows like
    Bill Nye the Science Guy and booted video games from my compact floppy disk
    collection.
These loves, as well as a curiosity about how things work, have carried
    throughout my post-secondary education and professional career.
Now, I am primarily a technologist, but I've also been a scientist and educator
    along the way.

## On the Grounds That I Don't Know the Answer
Since high school, I have pursued my interest in science through a diverse
    university education.
I first received a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree from the University of
    Waterloo, where I studied physics to better understand the world.
I chose to specialize in astrophysics—which involved learning about modelling
    and simulation—to also incorporate my love of computers.

Over the last few years, I have been working towards a Master of Science (M.Sc.)
    degree in psychology at McMaster University.
Studying psychology has also given me a better understanding of the world as
    I've learned about concepts such as human and non-human animal behaviour,
    cognition, and neuroscience.
This degree has also included learning about statistical analysis and scientific
    writing, as well as completing teaching assistantships and guest lectures.
Pursuing my M.Sc. had expanded my scientific knowledge beyond the physics
    discipline and has improved my educating capabilities.

Still, I have been able to apply my love of physics and computers in my M.Sc.
    thesis studying bat echolocation biophysics.
Specifically, I am trying to understand the spatial characteristics of vesper
    bat echolocation.
This work mainly involves audio signal analysis and computational modelling,
    though it has also given me an exciting experience working with bats.

## You Live and Learn
In tandem with my education, I have pursued a professional career in the
    manufacturing and software industries, where my love for computers has
    really thrived.
After receiving my B.Sc., I began my career in electrical engineering in a role
    involving quality assurance, testing, and customer support.
This job allowed me to realize my passion for system design.

Though, pursuing this passion has required a sizable effort as my software
    development skills are mostly self-taught.
During my undergraduate studies, I took a few Python and C++ courses, along with
    some courses about simulation, computational mathematics, and modelling.
Otherwise, I didn't learn about technology like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

This was until a friend asked me to build them a personalized web application.
I realized the technology for web application design is powerful and accessible,
    and I began learning more about it.
Since then, I have learned to build web application and cloud-based services,
    and now here we are.

### I Love Deadlines
Over the last five years, I have been writing software and building web
    applications concurrently with my M.Sc. studies.
Recently, I finished working on a contract project for a MRKTBOX e-commerce web
    application.
The project's goal was to create a multi-channel e-commerce application that
    intuitively supports cafe, catering, home delivery, and other special
    offerings.
The application comprises a custom back-end service with a re-written OpenTender
    front-end application.
The details of the MRKTBOX project are in my portfolio and the open source
    codebase is available on MRKTBOX's GitHub repository.

While working on this project, I also had opportunities to supervise
    programming-based college graduate projects and undergraduate co-op
    internships.
These were valuable experiences for improving my teaching and mentorship
    abilities.

Since finishing my work on the MRKTBOX project, I have been building this
    weblog.
Primarily, this involves building a platform to share my programming guides,
    professional tips, and other articles I've written (and will write).
This weblog is also a prototype for an open-source, modular, and extensible
    blogging service.
Essentially, this weblog is the current expression of my love for software
    design and development.
Sharing the software and the process of creating it is my contribution to the
    long-form content ecosystem.

## See First, Think Later, Then Test
Currently, I have a goal to apply what I've learned from studying science to my
    professional work.
Namely, I've learned that researching any phenomenon requires correct scientific
    process.
The definition of scientific process is a method of inquiry that is systematic,
    empirical, and reproducible.
By this definition, I think any approach to problem solving should follow
    scientific process.
A scientific approach provides a reliable framework to find the best solution to
    an enigmatic problem.
So, my priority is to build technology through scientific process.

## Let the Present Move Forward Into the Future
I believe software developers should think towards the future.
Personally, I want to create technology that will stand the test of time, either
    by being extensible or modular.
This way, new software solutions can be applied to problems outside their
    domain.

I also believe in the importance of decentralized, open-source technology.
Technology should be:
- accessible to everyone,
- easy to use,
- and free from monopolistic control.

Moving forward, I want to continue to learn the best ways of building
    open-source technology that promotes these values.

## Grapple With the Ineffable
I also want to teach what I've learned.
Throughout completing my teaching assistantships, guest lectures, and
    supervision of college projects and co-op internships, my desire to educate
    has solidified.
I know I wouldn't be where I am without the mentorship and guidance I've
    received along the way, and I want to provide the same for others.

One of the most important concepts I want to teach is that software innovation
    can only continue when new developers are trained with the fundamentals
    required to solve new problems.
Continuous research and investment into teaching computer programming will only
    become more important as technology continues to evolve.

Already, technology has become a necessary part of our lives.
However, differences in access to technology, "The Digital Divide", is a key
    factor in worsening inequity.
If we want a future free from oppression and classism, we have to remove
    socioeconomic barriers and fairly distribute resources.
Making software resources and tools freely available reduces the financial
    barrier for everyday use and careers in technology.
Thus, a future of equity requires working together and sharing knowledge of
    technology.
This weblog is my contribution to sharing knowledge and enabling others.

### At Any Rate, You Live
I have been told "[I] don't work very hard, but [I] work smart."
I want to share that gift with others, by:
- scientifically researching how to build educated solutions,
- building and sharing tools to manage complex and unintuitive problems,
- and teaching the skills so others can do the same.

In the end, I hope my efforts will contribute to scientific research,
    technological development, and education.
I can't fix all the problems in the world myself, but I can help others to in
    their work.
I will grow old realizing the future that classic science-fiction dreamed of, or
    die trying.
