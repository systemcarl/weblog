# Abstract
- I am Carl.
- I am a software developer, applied physicist, and web blogger.
    - I am curious about enigmatic topics.
    - I love learning new skills.
    - My goal is to share my enthusiasm for science, technology, and challenging
        questions.

# On the Grounds That I Don't Know the Answer[^adams]
- I'm Carl and I'm a nerd.
- My intension with this article is to introduce myself,
    give context to my work,
    and connect with the online community.

## I Have Ended Up Where I Need to Be
- I loved science and computers since I was very young.
    - I have always had a curiosity about how things work.
- Now I am a software developer, scientist, and educator.

### I'd Far Rather Be Happy Than Right
- I have pursued my interests in science and computers through my
    education.
- I received a [Bachelor of Science (BSc)] in [physics] from the
        [*University of Waterloo*].
    - I focused on mathematical modelling and computer simulation.
- I have  been working towards a [Master of Science (MSc)] degree in
    [psychology] at [*McMaster University*].
    - I have been taking courses, completing teaching assistantships, and
        giving guest lectures. 
    - My thesis research is about the biology of [vesper bat] echolocation.
        - This research utilizes my background in physics and programming
            through developing computational signal analysis tools to aggregate
            and analyze acoustic data.

### You Live and Learn
- While studying, I've also been pursuing a career in software development.
    - My love for computers has thrived, throughout my career.
    - My career began with a support role in electrical manufacturing.
        - The role involved:
            - quality assurance,
            - testing,
            - technical sales,
            - and incident management.
    - Troubleshooting and field repairing commercial-industrial control systems
        helped me realize my passion for systems design.
- I have since put a lot of effort into learning about software development.
    - I have only taken a few classes that used [*Python*] and [*C++*] in
        undergraduate simulation and modelling courses.
    - Otherwise my programming skills are self-taught.
- I began learning software development by modding video games, writing small
    automation scripts and free-lancing.
    - Most notably, I built a website for my friend [Jerry's business].
    - Making small websites showed me the potential of [*the web*].
    - This led me to learn more about:
        - [*HTML*],
        - [*CSS*],
        - [*JavaScript*],
        - [web servers],
        - and cloud infrastructure (*e.g.* [reverse proxies]).
    - I have been building web applications and services since then.

#### I Love Deadlines
- I have been writing software and building web applications for the last
    5 years.
    - This work was concurrent with my graduate studies.
    - Mostly, I worked on the [*MRKTBOX*] [e-commerce web application].
    - The goal was to create a multi-channel e-commerce application that could
        support small businesses including:
        - cafes,
        - catering,
        - home delivery,
        - and other special offerings.
- One of the most valuable experience was supervising co-op students and college
    projects.
    - A significant amount of my time was spent reviewing code, managing code
        repositories, and teaching best practices.
    - These were enlightening exercises in leadership and project management.
- Since finishing the *MRKTBOX* project, I have been studying, researching, and
    experimenting with new software technologies.
    - Building this weblog is one the results of this personal development.
    - My goal is to create a prototype for a blogging service that is:
        - open-source,
        - modular,
        - extensible,
        - and federated.
    - I am also writing:
        - programming guides,
        - professional tips,
        - and other articles.
    - This is a passion project devoted to software design and development.
    - The project combines development logs, how-to guides, and opinion pieces
        with the code of the blogging platform itself.
    - Sharing the software and the process is my contribution to the long-form
        content ecosystem.

## It Has Great Practical Value
- My education and career have shown me the power and importance of modern
    technology.
    - The last few decades of development have produced tools that improve our
        lives and have the potential to continue advancing society.
    - We now possess vast amounts of data and computational power.
    - There are still many problems our technology can help solve.
- Technology is not the problem itself.
    - Our application of the technology is the source of many problems.
    - Much of our infrastructure relies on centralized services.
    - The corporations that operate these services have proven to be incapable
        of self-moderation and have misaligned incentives.
    - Our demand for more computing power has necessitated our dependence on
        this private infrastructure.
    - Our future will continue to depend on these services unless we address
        these issues.
- Fortunately, there are initiatives to embrace technology to solve these
    problems with safety and security in mind.
    - Federated systems are making social platforms more autonomous and
        democratic;
        - *e.g.* [*Mastodon*].
    - Local-first architecture is giving users more control over their data.
    - We still have a lot to learn in order to satisfy all of our needs.

### See First, Think Later, Then Test
- My goal is to apply my scientific training to software development.
    - Effective research requires the scientific method.
    - The scientific method is systematic, empirical, and reproducible.
    - Any attempt at problem solving can follow the scientific method.
        - This includes product design and project management.
    - The scientific method provides a framework for reliably finding solutions
        to complex problems.
    - The outcomes of using the scientific method are based on unbiased evidence
        and reason.

### Let the Present Move Forward Into the Future
- Software developers should be thinking about the future.
    - Incremental milestones are important.
    - Effective milestones require clear direction.
- I want to build technology that last.
    - Lasting software is modular and extensible.
    - Flexible software can be applied to problems outside its original
        domain.
    - Creating software that enables future development is a great achievement.

### Grapple With the Ineffable
- More than anything, I want to teach what I have learned.
    - My experience completing teaching assistantships, guest lecturing, and
        supervising software students has motivated me to continue teaching.
    - The mentorship and guidance I received was crucial to my career.
    - I want to provide the same mentorship and guidance to others.
- Software innovation can only continue when new developers are trained with the
    necessary fundamentals.
    - Research and investment into teaching computer programming will become
        more important as technology continues to become more demanding.
- Technology is a necessary part of our lives.
    - Worsening inequality can be attributed to differences in access to
        technology, ["The Digital Divide"].
    - A future free from inequality requires removing socioeconomic barriers.
    - Making software resources and tools freely available removes financial
        barriers.
    - Working together and sharing knowledge is the achieve equity.
    - This weblog is my contribution to sharing and enabling other software
        developers.

## At Any Rate, You Live
- I have been told "[I] don't work very hard, but [I] work smart."
    - I want to share that gift with others, by:
        - conducting empirical research to build educated solutions,
        - building and sharing tools to manage complex and unintuitive problems,
        - or teaching the skills to do the same.
- I hope my effort will contribute to scientific research, technological
    development, and education.
    - I want to help create a better future for everyone.
    - If I don't live to see a classic science-fiction future,
        I'll have died trying.
