# About Me
- I am a technologist, scientist, and educator.
    - I do not enjoy writing about myself.
    - However, A short autobiography may be necessary to provide context for the
        rest of [my writing] and
        [my projects].
    - This also serves as a personal introduction to my work, and (hopefully) a
        way to connect with with the online community.
    - It will be a good opportunity to reflect on past successes and failures.

## A Journey So Far
- I have always loved science and computers.
    - As a young child I watched PBS shows like Bill Nye the Science Guy, and
        booted video games from my compact floppy disk collection.
    - My curiosity about how things work carried my interest through high school
        university, and professional career.
- I went on to pursue a diverse education in science.
    - In university, studying physics was a an obvious choice for better
        understanding the world.
        - Specializing in astrophysics happened naturally with my affinity for
            computer modelling and simulation.
    - My passion for scientific inquiry led to a M.Sc. in Psychology at McMaster
        University
        - I found an opportunity to apply my knowledge of computer science and
            physics, a project studying the biophysics of bat echolocation.
- My professional work has been in the manufacturing and software industries.
    - I began my career in electrical engineering, responsible for quality
        assurance, testing, and customer support.
    - I transitioned to software development building web application and
        cloud-based services after realizing my passion for system design.
- I still love learn about science & technology, and sharing my knowledge.
    - My research and writing can be found here, in [my weblog].
    - I take every opportunity to learn new skills and teach others.
    - Academia is a natural environment for sharing knowledge.
    - All of my professional work has involved training and mentoring.

### Philosophy of Science
- The definition of scientific process is a method of inquiry that is
    systematic, empirical, and reproducible.
    - Science is not just a body of knowledge or a collection of disciplines.
    - Understanding and applying the scientific method helps us establish
        objective facts about the world.
        - However, scientific hypotheses cannot be proved true, only disproved
            as false.
- Scientific literacy is important for everyone, not just academics.
    - It is essential to be able to critically evaluate information in a world
        dependent on science and technology,
    - The necessity of scientific literacy has motivated my pursuit of
        education.
    - The goal is to investigate problems and share the knowledge gained.

#### Continuous Education
- I have continued my education in parallel with my career.
    - Currently, I am working on a M.Sc. thesis in Psychology.
    - My research is centered around understanding the spatial characteristics
        of [vesper bat] echolocation.
        - Much of the work is focused on audio signal analysis and computational
            modelling.
    - My study was in the Department Of Psychology, Neuroscience & Behaviour
        at McMaster University.
        - Course work and assistantships extended my education beyond the
            discipline of physics.
        - I learned the nuance of statistical analysis and scientific writing.
- Studying science taught me a scientific approach to problem solving provides
    a reliable framework for finding objective solutions.
    - Complex problems require a systematic approach.
    - Observing, research, experimentation, and analysis are all essential
        steps in addressing any enigmatic problem.
    - I have learned how to apply this methodology to my work through concurrent
        education and practical experience.

#### Science of Software
- The goal of information technology has been to build intuitive systems and
    interfaces
    - Recent advancements in computer science have been in pursuit of creating
        technology that can intuitively perceive and react to the external
        world.
        - This is an interesting topic of psychology.
    - There is still much to be learned about how to build systems that satisfy
        our current ambitions.
    - Further technological advancements will require scientific discovery.
- I plan to continue my research within the fields of computer science,
    psychology, and physics.
    - Experimenting with modern technologies provides endless opportunity to
        make observations and collect data.
    - The modularity of software solutions allows new solutions to be applied to
        problems outside their domain.
    - My priority is primarily to build technology through scientific practice.
    - I hope my efforts will also contribute to future scientific research and
        education.

### Modern, Accessible Technology
- For a long time, I did not consider a career in software development.
    - I am mostly self taught.
    - I have only taken few formal Python & C++ classes.
        - During my undergraduate studies, I took some courses about simulation,
            computational mathematics, and modelling.
    - It wasn't until after working in electrical engineering that I realized
        software development could be viable career.
    - Not knowing anything about HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, I was reluctant to
        learn about web application.
        - I realized the power & accessibility of the technology after building
            a web application myself.

#### Recent Projects
- Over the last 5 years I have also been writing software and building web
    applications.
    - Much of my software development work happened concurrently with my
        graduate studies.
    - From 2020 to 2025, I worked on the [MRKTBOX e-commerce web application] on
        and off.
    - The goal was to create a multi-channel e-commerce application that
        intuitively supported cafe, catering, home delivery and other special
        offerings.
    - The application comprises a custom back-end service with using a
        [re-written OpenTender front-end application].
    - The details of the [MRKTBOX project] are in my [portfolio].
    - The open source code-base is available on [MRKTBOX's GitHub repository].
- Since finishing the MRKTBOX project, I have been working on [this weblog].
    - Primarily, I am building a platform for sharing guides, professional tips,
        and other articles.
    - This is also a prototype for an open-source, modular, & extensible
        blogging service.
    - The project is a case study in software design and development.
    - Sharing the software and the process of creating the software is my
        contribution to long-form content ecosystem.

#### Building With Integrity
- I believe in thinking towards the future, and creating technology that
    will stand the test of time, either by being extensible or modular.
    - I believe in the importance of decentralized, open-source technology.
        - Technology should be:
            - accessible to everyone,
            - easy to use,
            - and free from monopolistic control.
    - Moving forward, I want to continue to build open-source technology that
        promotes these values.

### The Best Way to Learn
- There's nothing that I value more than learning.
    - If we have nothing else, we have our knowledge and experience.
    - As a life-long learner, I am always looking for new ways to progress,
        grow, and explore.
- There's no better way to learn than by teaching.
    - I take every opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with others.
    - Teaching science and programming has been a rewarding experience:
        - guest lecturing and assisting with courses at McMaster University,
        - supervising college graduate projects and undergraduate coop
            internships.
- As software development becomes more complex, the need for collaboration and
    communication is more important than ever.
    - Continuous investment and research into teaching computer programming will
        only become more important.
    - Innovation can only continue when new developers are trained and mentored,
        with the fundamentals required to solve new, unsolved problems.

## Looking Towards the Future
- My ultimate goal is to empower others to do more with less.
    - I have been told "[I] don't work very hard, but [I] work smart."
    - I want to share that gift with others, by:
        - teaching the skills to manage complex & unintuitive problems,
        - doing empirical research to build educated solutions,
        - or building and sharing the tools.
    - A future of equity requires working together and sharing knowledge and
        technology.
    - Pushing boundaries is only possible when future generations are given
        more resources and opportunities.
- The world isn't yet perfect.
    - If I can't fix the all the problems in the world myself, hopefully I can
        help others to do the job.
    - I plan to grow old realizing the future the 1960's science-fiction dreamed
        about, or die trying.
