# Abstract
- I am a technologist, scientist, and educator;
    - I have been involved in several commercial and academic projects which
        have given me valuable opportunities to learn and teach.
- My mission is to share my knowledge and resources to promote the use of
    technology in industry, education, & research.

# About Me
- I am a technologist, scientist, and educator.
    - I do not enjoy writing about myself.
    - However, A short autobiography may be necessary to provide context for the
        rest of [my writing] and
        [my projects].
    - This also serves as a personal introduction to my work, and (hopefully) a
        way to connect with with the online community.
    - It will be a good opportunity to reflect on past successes and failures.

## A Journey So Far
- I have always loved science and computers.
    - As a young child I watched PBS shows like Bill Nye the Science Guy, and
        booted video games from my compact floppy disk collection.
    - My curiosity about how things work carried my interest through high school
        university, and professional career.
- I went on to pursue a diverse education in science.
    - In university, studying physics was a an obvious choice for better
        understanding the world.
        - Specializing in astrophysics happened naturally with my affinity for
            computer modelling and simulation.
    - My passion for scientific inquiry led to a M.Sc. in Psychology at McMaster
        University
        - I found an opportunity to apply my knowledge of computer science and
            physics, a project studying the biophysics of bat echolocation.
- My professional work has been in the manufacturing and software industries.
    - I began my career in electrical engineering, responsible for quality
        assurance, testing, and customer support.
    - I transitioned to software development building web application and
        cloud-based services after realizing my passion for system design.
- I still love learn about science & technology, and sharing my knowledge.
    - My research and writing can be found here, in [my weblog].
    - I take every opportunity to learn new skills and teach others.
    - Academia is a natural environment for sharing knowledge.
    - All of my professional work has involved training and mentoring.


### Modern, Accessible Technology
- My time over the last 5 years has been spent writing software and building web
    applications.
    - Mostly self taught, with only a few formal Python & C++ classes in my
        undergraduate studies, I didn't consider a career in software until
        a few years after graduating.
    - I was reluctant to learn about web application, not knowing anything about
        HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
    - But I realized it is powerful & accessible technology.
- My entire [portfolio] is available online.
    - Most projects are described in detail here in my [portfolio].
    - All the code is available on [my GitHub profile].
- Recently, I have been working on the [MRKTBOX e-commerce web application].
    - The project was conceived in late 2020, and I worked on it off and on, for
        the 5 years.
    - The scope of the project changed over time.
    - The goal was to create a multi-channel e-commerce application the
        intuitively supported cafe, catering, home delivery and other special
        offerings.
    - The application comprises a custom back-end service with using a
        [re-written OpenTender front-end application].
    - The details of the [MRKTBOX project] are in my [portfolio].
    - The open source code-base is available on [MRKTBOX's GitHub repository].
- Since then, I've been working on [this weblog].
    - The goal is to create an open-source, self-hosted, modular, and extensible
        blogging service that is easy to use and maintain.
    - My priority is to create modern, accessible technology that is easy to use
        and maintain.
- I believe in thinking towards the future, and creating technology that
    will stand the test of time, either by being extensible or modular.
    - I believe in the importance of decentralized, open-source technology.
        - Technology should be:
            - accessible to everyone,
            - easy to use,
            - and free from monopolistic control.
    - Moving forward, I want to continue to build open-source technology that
        promotes these values.

### Philosophy of Science
- The definition of scientific process is a method of inquiry that is
    systematic, empirical, and reproducible.
    - Science is not just a body of knowledge or a collection of disciplines.
    - Understanding and applying the scientific method helps us establish
        objective facts about the world.
    - Without science, conclusions are biased but individual observations.
- Scientific literacy is important for everyone, not just academics.
    - I've committed a significant amount of time to learning and teaching
        within the scientific community.
    - A scientific approach to problem solving provides a reliable framework for
        finding objective solutions to complex problems.
- Currently, I am working on a M.Sc. thesis in Psychology
    - My research is centered around understanding the spatial characteristics
        of [vesper bat] echolocation.
    - Much of the work is focused on audio signal analysis and computational
        modelling.
    - My study has taught me the nuance of statistical analysis and scientific
        writing.
- I plan to continue my research between the fields of computer science,
    psychology, and physics.
    - Over the last few decades the primary goal of information technology has
        been to build systems and interfaces that are approachable and intuitive
        to the human user.
    - Recent goals of computer science are to perceive and react to the real
        physical world.
    - Ultimately, there is much to be learned still across all these fields,
        especially their intersections.
    - My priority is primarily to build technology, but I hope that effort will
        also contribute to the scientific community.

### The Best Way to Learn
- There's nothing that I value more than learning.
    - If we have nothing else, we have our knowledge and experience.
    - As a life-long learner, I am always looking for new ways to progress,
        grow, and explore.
- There's no better way to learn than by teaching.
    - I take every opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with others.
    - Teaching science and programming has been a rewarding experience:
        - guest lecturing and assisting with courses at McMaster University,
        - supervising college graduate projects and undergraduate coop
            internships.
- As software development becomes more complex, the need for collaboration and
    communication is more important than ever.
    - Continuous investment and research into teaching computer programming will
        only become more important.
    - Innovation can only continue when new developers are trained and mentored,
        with the fundamentals required to solve new, unsolved problems.

## Looking Towards the Future
- My ultimate goal is to empower others to do more with less.
    - I have been told "[I] don't work very hard, but [I] work smart."
    - I want to share that gift with others, by:
        - teaching the skills to manage complex & unintuitive problems,
        - doing empirical research to build educated solutions,
        - or building and sharing the tools.
    - A future of equity requires working together and sharing knowledge and
        technology.
    - Pushing boundaries is only possible when future generations are given
        more resources and opportunities.
- The world isn't yet perfect.
    - If I can't fix the all the problems in the world myself, hopefully I can
        help others to do the job.
    - I plan to grow old realizing the future the 1960's science-fiction dreamed
        about, or die trying.

### So Long, And Thanks for All the Fish
