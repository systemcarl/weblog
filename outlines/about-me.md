# Abstract
- I am Carl.
- I am a software developer, applied physicist, and technology writer.
    - I love enigmatic topics, learning skills, and teaching others.
    - I want to drive technological innovation for a better future.

# On the Grounds That I Don't Know the Answer[^adams]
- I'm Carl and I'm a nerd.
- My intension with this article is to
    - introduce myself,
    - give context to my work,
    - and connect with the online community.

## I Have Ended Up Where I Need to Be
- I have always loved science and computers.
    - I have had a curiosity about how things work since I was very young.
    - Now I am a software developer, scientist, and educator.

### I'd Far Rather Be Happy Than Right
- I have pursued my interests in science and computers through my education.
    - I received a [Bachelor of Science (BSc)] in [physics] from the
            [*University of Waterloo*].
    - I focused on mathematical modelling and computer simulation.
- I have been working towards a [Master of Science (MSc)] degree in
    [psychology] at [*McMaster University*].
    - I have been taking courses, completing teaching assistantships, and
        giving guest lectures.
    - My thesis research is about the biology of [vesper bat] [echolocation].
        - This research uses my background in physics and programming.
            - I have been developing computational signal analysis tools to
                aggregate and analyze acoustic data.

### You Live and Learn
- My career began with a support role in electrical manufacturing.
    - The role involved:
        - quality assurance,
        - system testing,
        - technical sales,
        - and incident management.
    - This work helped me realize my passion for systems design.
- I have since put a lot of effort into learning about software development.
    - I learned the basics of [*Python*] and [*C++*] from undergraduate courses.
    - Otherwise my programming skills are self-taught.
- My early experience was from hobbyist and freelance work.
    - Building a website for my friend [Jerry's business] was my foyer into web
        development.
    - I've since learned more about:
        - [*HTML*],
        - [*CSS*],
        - [*JavaScript*],
        - [web servers],
        - and cloud infrastructure.
- Since developing my programming skills, I have focused on building web
    applications and services.

#### I Love Deadlines
- I have been professionally writing software and building web applications
    for the last 5 years.
    - I worked on the [*MRKTBOX*] [e-commerce web application].
        - The goal was to create an e-commerce application that could
            handle a variety of food and beverage business needs.
- I also supervised co-op students and college projects while working at
    [*MRKTBOX*].
    - These were enlightening exercises in leadership and project management.
- I am currently working on this weblog and the underlying software platform.
    - My goal is to create a prototype for a blogging service that is:
        - open-source,
        - modular,
        - extensible,
        - and federated.
    - This project combines my educational topics with the code of the blogging
        platform itself.

## It Has Great Practical Value
- My education and career have shown me the power and importance of technology.
    - New tools continually improve our lives.
    - Modern technology has the potential to both empower and oppress us.
- Continued efforts to find new technological solutions and applications will
    require more research and development.

### See First, Think Later, Then Test
- My goal is to apply my scientific training to software development.
    - Any attempt at problem solving can follow the scientific method.
        - *i.e.* a systematic, empirical, and reproducible process.
    - This includes product design and project management.

### Let the Present Move Forward Into the Future
- Software developers should be thinking about the future.
- I want to build modular, extensible technology that lasts.
    - Creating software that enables future development is a great achievement.

### Grapple With the Ineffable
- I want to teach what I have learned.
    - I aim to provide mentorship and guidance for others.
- Research and investment into computer programming education will become more
    important as technology continues to evolve.
    - Software innovation requires new developers to be trained with the
        necessary fundamentals.
- Making software resources and tools freely available is the way to achieve
    equity.
    - Access to technology is one of the driving factors in the
        ["The Digital Divide"].
    - This weblog is my contribution to sharing and enabling other software
        developers.

## At Any Rate, You Live
- Overall, I want to:
    - conduct empirical research on building educated solutions,
    - build and share tools to manage complex and unintuitive problems,
    - and teach the skills for others to do the same.
- I want to help create a better future for everyone by
    - contributing to scientific research,
    - technological development,
    - and education.
