# Abstract
- I am a technologist, scientist, and educator;
    - I have been involved in several commercial and academic projects which
        have given me valuable opportunities to learn and teach.
- My mission is to share my knowledge and resources to promote the use of
    technology in industry, education, & research.

# On the Grounds That I Don't Know the Answer
- I am a technologist, scientist, and educator.
    - I am passionate about science and technology, and take every opportunity
        to share my passion.
    - I am an unapologetic nerd.
    - I love anything intellectually or philosophically challenging:
        - classic science fiction, *e.g.* Star Trek (The Original Series);
        - games, in any form, but especially those that are inspiring or
            creative;
        - questions of aesthetics, ethics, and morality;
- Everything to know about me is available here in [my writing].
    - I find it challenging to write about myself.
    - It may be necessary to provide context for the rest of my articles and
        [my projects].
    - A short autobiography also serves as a personal introduction to my
        work, and a way to connect with the online community.

## I Have Ended Up Where I Need to Be
- I have always loved science and computers.
    - As a young child I watched PBS shows like Bill Nye the Science Guy, and
        booted video games from my compact floppy disk collection.
    - My curiosity about how things work carried my interest through school and my professional career.
      
- Since high school, I have pursued my interest in science through a diverse education in (at?) university.
    - As an undergraduate student at (however you want to explain) university, studying physics was an obvious choice for better
        understanding the world.
        - Specializing in astrophysics happened naturally with my affinity for
            computer modelling and simulation.
    - I have also been working towards a M.Sc. in Psychology at McMaster
        University
        - This degree has included researching bats, scientific writing, course work studying concepts in psychology and statistical analysis, and teaching assistantships
           - These have diversified my knowledge of scientific inquiry beyond the discipline of physics  
        - Still, I was able to apply my knowledge of computers and
            physics in a thesis studying the biophysics of bat echolocation.
          - Specifically, I am trying to understand the spatial characteristics
                of [vesper bat] echolocation.
          - Much of the work is focused on audio signal analysis and computational
                modelling.
            
 ### See First, Think Later, Then Test --I think I prefer this heading
 #### I'd Rather Be Happy Than Right
- Studying science has taught me problem solving through a scientific approach provides
    a reliable framework for finding objective solutions.
    - Observation, experimentation, analysis, and clear communication are all essential
        steps in addressing any enigmatic problem.
    - The goal is not to be "correct", but to discover the best solution.
- Studying science has also taught me scientific literacy is important for everyone, not just academics.
    - It is essential to be able to critically evaluate information
- Overall, my experience designing, conducting, and communicating technical behavioral experiments
        has instilled a rigorous discipline in my everyday life and professional work.
               

    


- I have also pursued my love of computers (? if not computers, maybe technology. just try to link to hook sentence) in the manufacturing and software industries.
    - I began my career in electrical engineering, responsible for quality
        assurance, testing, and customer support.
    - I have since realized my passion for system design.
        - So, I have transitioned to software development through building web application and
        cloud-based services.

### What We Really Want Is Stuff That Works
- For a long time, I did not consider a career in software development.
    - It wasn't until after working in electrical engineering that I realized
        software development could be viable career.
- I am mostly self taught
    - I have only taken a few formal Python & C++ classes.
        - During my undergraduate studies, I took some courses about simulation,
            computational mathematics, and modelling.
- Not knowing anything about HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, I was reluctant to
        learn about web application.
    - I realized the power & accessibility of the technology after building
            a web application myself.

  #### I Love Deadlines
- Over the last 5 years I have been writing software and building web
    applications.
    - Much of my software development work happened concurrently with my
        graduate studies.
    - From 2020 to 2025, I worked on the [MRKTBOX e-commerce web application] on
        and off.
    - The goal was to create a multi-channel e-commerce application that
        intuitively supported cafe, catering, home delivery and other special
        offerings.
    - The application comprises a custom back-end service with using a
        [re-written OpenTender front-end application].
    - The details of the [MRKTBOX project] are in my [portfolio].
    - The open source code-base is available on [MRKTBOX's GitHub repository].
- Since finishing the MRKTBOX project, I have been working on [this weblog].
    - Primarily, I am building a platform for sharing guides, professional tips,
        and other articles.
    - This is also a prototype for an open-source, modular, & extensible
        blogging service.
    - The project is a case study in software design and development.
    - Sharing the software and the process of creating the software is my
        contribution to long-form content ecosystem.
      
#### It Has Great Practical Value
- My priority is primarily to build technology through scientific practice.
    - Experimenting with modern technologies provides endless opportunity to
        make observations and collect data.
    - The modularity of software solutions allows new solutions to be applied to
        problems outside their domain.
- There is still much to be learned about how to build systems that satisfy
        our current ambitions.    
    - As a life-long learner, I am always looking for new ways to progress, grow, and explore.
    - If we have nothing else, we have our knowledge and experience.



- Recent advancements in computer science have been in pursuit of creating
        technology that can intuitively perceive and react to the external
        world.
        - This is an interesting topic of psychology. ---see comment---
   

#### Grapple With the Ineffable
- I believe in thinking towards the future, and creating technology that
    will stand the test of time, either by being extensible or modular.
    - I believe in the importance of decentralized, open-source technology.
        - Technology should be:
            - accessible to everyone,
            - easy to use,
            - and free from monopolistic control.
    - Moving forward, I want to continue to build open-source technology that
        promotes these values.

### You Live and Learn

- There's no better way to learn than by teaching.
    - I take every opportunity to share my knowledge and experience with others.
    - Teaching science and programming has been a rewarding experience.
        - I have guest lectured and assisted with courses at McMaster
            University.
        - I supervised college graduate projects and undergraduate coop
            internships.

#### At Any Rate, You Live
- As software development becomes more complex, the need for collaboration and
    communication is more important than ever.
    - Software development is now rarely a solo endeavour.
    - Continuous investment and research into teaching computer programming will
        only become more important as technology continues to evolve.
    - Innovation can only continue when new developers are trained and mentored,
        with the fundamentals required to solve new, unsolved problems.
- I will continue to share, mentor, and teach.
    - Without the mentorship, guidance I received, I would not have the
        abilities I have now.
    - This [weblog] is one way I can share knowledge and enable others.
    - I will surely continue to mentor throughout my career.

## Let the Present Move Forward Into the Future
- A future of equity requires working together and sharing knowledge and
    technology.
    - I we want a future free from oppression and classism, we must remove
        socioeconomic barriers and fairly distribute resources.
    - Digital technology has become a necessary part of our lives.
    - Differences in access to technology, ["The Digital Divide"], is a key
        factor in worsening inequality.
    - Making software resources and tools freely available reduces the financial
        barrier for everyday use and careers in technology.
- Pushing boundaries is only possible when future generations are given more
    resources and opportunities.
    - Progress will only continue when we empower each other to do more.
    - I have been told "[I] don't work very hard, but [I] work smart."
    - I want to share that gift with others, by:
        - teaching the skills to manage complex & unintuitive problems,
        - doing empirical research to build educated solutions,
        - or building and sharing the tools.
- The world isn't yet perfect.
    - I can't fix all the problems in the world myself, but I can help others to
        in their work.
    - I will grow old realizing the future the 1960's science-fiction dreamed
        about, or die trying.

- I plan to continue my research within the fields of computer science,
    psychology, and physics.
- I hope my efforts will also contribute to future scientific research and
        education.
