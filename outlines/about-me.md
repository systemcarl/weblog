# Abstract
- I am Carl.
- I am a software developer, applied physicist, and technology writer.
    - I love enigmatic topics, learning skills, and teaching others.
    - I want to drive technological innovation for a better future.

# On the Grounds That I Don't Know the Answer[^adams]
- I'm Carl and I'm a nerd.
- My intension with this article is to introduce myself,
    give context to my work,
    and connect with the online community.

## I Have Ended Up Where I Need to Be
- I loved science and computers since I was very young.
    - I have always had a curiosity about how things work.
- Now I am a software developer, scientist, and educator.

### I'd Far Rather Be Happy Than Right
- I have pursued my interests in science and computers through my
    education.
- I received a [Bachelor of Science (BSc)] in [physics] from the
        [*University of Waterloo*].
    - I focused on mathematical modelling and computer simulation.
- I have  been working towards a [Master of Science (MSc)] degree in
    [psychology] at [*McMaster University*].
    - I have been taking courses, completing teaching assistantships, and
        giving guest lectures. 
    - My thesis research is about the biology of [vesper bat] echolocation.
        - This research utilizes my background in physics and programming
            through developing computational signal analysis tools to aggregate
            and analyze acoustic data.

### You Live and Learn
- While studying, I've also been pursuing a career in software development,
    where my love for computers has thrived.
- My career began with a support role in electrical manufacturing.
    - Troubleshooting and field repairing commercial-industrial control systems
        helped me realize my passion for systems design.
- I have since put a lot of effort into learning about software development.
    - Knowing a bit about Python and C++,
        I began with modding video games, writing small
        automation scripts and free-lancing.
        - Most notably, I built a website for my friend [Jerry's business]
            early in my career.
    - I've since learned more about:
        - [*HTML*]
        - [*CSS*]
        - [*JavaScript*]
        - [web servers]
        - cloud infrastructure (*e.g.* [reverse proxies])
- I have been building web applications and services since then.

#### I Love Deadlines
- I have been profesionally writing software and building web applications
    for the last 5 years.
    - Mostly, I worked on the [*MRKTBOX*] [e-commerce web application].
        - The goal was to create a multi-channel e-commerce application that could
            support small business needs.
        - During this, I also supervised co-op students and college
            projects.
            - These were enlightening exercises in leadership and project management.
- Since finishing the *MRKTBOX* project, I have been
    experimenting with new software technologies.
- Building this weblog is one result of this personal development.
    - My goal is to create a prototype for a blogging service that is:
        - open-source
        - modular
        - extensible
        - federated
    - The project combines my development logs, how-to guides, and opinion pieces
        with the code of the blogging platform itself.
    - Sharing the software and its development process
        is my contribution to the long-form content ecosystem.

## It Has Great Practical Value
- My education and career have shown me the power and importance of modern
    technology.
- The last few decades of development have produced tools that improve our
    lives and have the potential to continue advancing society.
- However, our application of the technology is the source of many problems.
    - *e.g.* Much of our infrastructure relies on centralized services
        from corporations incapable of self-moderation.
- Fortunately, there are initiatives embracing technology to solve these
    problems with safety and security in mind.
    - Federated systems are making social platforms more autonomous and
        democratic;
        - *e.g.* [*Mastodon*].
    - Local-first architecture is giving users more control over their data.
- Though, we still have a lot to learn in order to satisfy all of our needs.

### See First, Think Later, Then Test
- My goal is to apply my scientific training to software development.
- Any attempt at problem solving can follow the scientific method
    (*i.e.* a systematic, empirical, and reproducible process).
    - This includes product design and project management.

### Let the Present Move Forward Into the Future
- Software developers should be thinking about the future.
- I want to build technology that lasts because it's modular and extensible.
- Creating software that enables future development is a great achievement.

### Grapple With the Ineffable
- More than anything, I want to teach what I have learned,
    and provide mentoriship and guidance for others.
- Research and investment into teaching computer programming will become
    more important as technology continues to become more demanding.
    - Software innovation can only continue when new developers are trained with the
        necessary fundamentals.
- Making software resources and tools freely available is the way to achieve equity.
    - This weblog is my contribution to sharing and enabling other software
        developers.

## At Any Rate, You Live
- Overall, I want to:
    - conduct empirical research on building educated solutions
    - build and share tools to manage complex and unintuitive problems
    - teach the skills for others to do the same
- I want to help create a better future for everyone
- by contributing to scientific research, technological
    development, and education.
