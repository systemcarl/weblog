# Goals, Values, and Validation
<!-- TODO: describe the purpose of having goals, values, and validation -->

## Goals
<!-- TODO: introduction -->
- The structure and definition of the goal is not important, but the principles
    influence the project.
    - This is not a prescriptive process, so the goal can be defined in the best
        way that makes sense for your project.
    - For this process, the goal should be
        - comprehensive,
        - actionable,
        - achievable,
        - and verifiable.
    - The simpler the goal, the better.

### A Contrived Goal
- The statement "drink less coffee" is not ideal in this context.
    - The goal is not comprehensive or verifiable; what defines less?
    - The goal is actionable but not very achievable; it is not clear how
        to drink less coffee.
    - Instead, a better goal would be "drink only one coffee a day."
- Other examples can be found in the case studies for this process.
    - These can be found in the articles:
        - [*Planning a Personal Site*](
            ./planning-a-personal-site.md/#step-1),
        - and [*Planning a Blog Service*](
            ./planning-a-blog-service.md/#step-1).
    - While these goals are not precise, they are comprehensive.

## Values
<!-- TODO: introduction -->
- The difference between values & goals can be difficult to distinguish. <!-- Ref? -->
    - While goals are defined by future aspirations, values and principles apply
        to the present.
    - Values and principles are also less discrete than goals, shifting
        validation way from an authoritative pass/fail approach to a more
        subjective and constructive evaluation.
    - The goal describes the problem and solution, while the values describe
        the motivation for addressing the problem and investing in the solution.

### Some Contrived Values
- A goal of "drink only one coffee a day" can be broken down into
    values such as "making healthier decisions," "minimizing caffeine
    consumption," or "consuming more mindfully."
    - Values help promote decisions that are aligned with drinking less coffee.
    - There the goal doesn't consider when or how to drink coffee, and ambiguity
        can undermine self-control.
    - Even if you don't succeed, following the values can still be beneficial to
        your health.
    - Decaffeinated coffee is a good alternative, not well described by the
        goal.

## Validation
<!-- TODO: introduction -->
- Validation can bridge the gap between the goal and the values. <!-- Ref? -->
    - The goal itself should be verifiable, and thus easy to validate, but
        validation can also be used to evaluate the application of values.
    - While values are designed to influence decisions, they are not
        prescriptive and cannot always be applied at the time of implementation.
    - Validation can be used to evaluate project progress in retrospect to
        determine if the values are being applied in a way that will lead to
        the goal.

### Some Contrived Validation
- "How many coffees have I drank so far this week?" may be too rigid.
    - A running tally may encourage drinking more coffee to "catch up" to 1
        per day, detracting from progress.
    - A better question would be "What did I drink this week?"
        - This question is more open-ended, providing more information than
            just coffee consumption.
        - If coffee consumption is low, then adequate alternatives can be
            inferred.
        - If coffee consumption is high, maybe the alternatives are not as
            effective as expected.
        - Some alternatives may not be preferable to coffee, *e.g.* tea,
            soda, or energy drinks.
