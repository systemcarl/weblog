# Abstract
- The MRKTBOX grocery e-commerce web application was my first sizable production
    project.
- From 2020 to 2025, I oversaw the development of multiple iterations of the
    full-stack solution.
- Development culminated in a prototype for a software as a service (SaaS) food
    & beverage e-commerce platform, called Batched.

# MRKTBOX
- I started doing information technology (IT) work for [MRKTBOX](
    https://mrktbox.com) while working part-time doing grocery delivery.
    - After months of automating spreadsheet tasks, we began to explore
        a more integrated solution for managing grocery orders.
    - The project eventually to evolved into a Software as a Service (SaaS)
        e-commerce platform for food & beverage businesses,
        [Batched](https://batched.ca).

## Redefining Food & Beverage E-Commerce
- Through years of product development, we created a novel approach for solving
    common problems for small grocery & food businesses.
    - The application provided an intuitive experience for managing grocery
        orders, specifically recurring (subscription) items.
    - Our approach to defining service channels was flexible and
        non-prescriptive, allowing businesses to define their own terms.
    - The headless, integration-first architecture promoted interoperability
        with existing client systems.
- The latest iteration of the MRKTBOX application was developed as a prototype
    for Batched.
    - With the help of [Aidan Wigmore]() and [Leon Chung](), we built a
        the a custom, scalable, full-stack solution.
    - The front-end was forked from the open-source React app, [Open Tender](
        https://github.com/MRKTBOX/mrktbox-web/tree/fork/open-tender).
        - *Open Tender* was acquired by [ItsaCheckmate] in 2023, and no longer
            maintained.
    - The front-end was refactored and extended to integrate with the Batched
        platform API.
        - The forked application is available on
            [GitHub](https://github.com/MRKTBOX/mrktbox-web)
