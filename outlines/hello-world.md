# Hello World
- Hello!
- This first post is an introduction to my weblog content.
    - The purpose of this weblog is to share my tips, guides, and other insights
        about:
        - technology,
        - science,
        - and anything else that interests me.

## Master of None
- I am far from a leading expert in any one of these fields.
    - I excel at learning new skills and transferring expertise between
        disciplines.
    - Researching new topics is a significant part of my work.
- Anything I find that is not widely known or well documented is reported here.
    - These articles include software development tips and guides:
        - [Mocking Svelte 5 Components].

## Committing to Open Development
- I write semi-regular development logs (DevLogs), documenting all my open
    projects.
    - These are to promote project updates and share the development process.
    - The purpose is to provide insight into the software development process,
        beyond just the basic tools and programming skills.
- These articles include:
    - [Setting Up SvelteKit for a Personal Weblog]
    - [Exploring CI/CD for a Modern (SvelteKit) Web Application]
    - [Designing a Content Template]
    - [Implementing a Weblog Markdown Parser]
