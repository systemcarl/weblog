# Hello World
- Hello!
- This first post is an introduction to my weblog content.
    - The purpose of this weblog is to share my tips, guides, and other insights
        about:
        - technology,
        - science,
        - and anything else that interests me.

## Committing to Open Development
- I write semi-regular development logs (DevLogs), documenting all my open
    projects.
    - These are to promote project updates and share the development process.
    - The purpose is to provide insight into the software development process,
        beyond just the basic tools and programming skills.
