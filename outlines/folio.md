# Abstract
- My most significant personal project is this personal website, portfolio, and
    weblog.
- My personal website is a custom, full-stack, self-hosted solution with minimal
    dependencies.
- The project is a showcase of my skills in web development, design, &
    content creation.

# Carl Edward Lyons; Website, Portfolio, & Weblog
- If you are reading this, you are likely viewing it via my personal website,
    [carledwardlyons.ca](https://carledwardlyons.ca).
    - This website serves as an integrated portfolio, weblog, and personal
        website.
    - Seamlessly combining weblog articles with portfolio projects gives me the
        opportunity to display my skills & creativity.
        - The entire website is built as a custom, full-stack, self-hosted
            solution.
        - Building a custom experience is a great way to experiment with new
            product design ideas.
        - This space is also a place to experiment & practice my development
            and design skills.
- The goal of this project is to create a personal website serves and promotes
    my technological values & beliefs.
    - My intent is to build a modern, sharable, extensible, and easy-to-use
        application.
    - Using this solution, I aim to share my skills & knowledge to promote
        equity, literacy, and accessibility in technology.

## You Are Here
- I have taken the time to document the entirety of the website development
    process.
    - A significant amount of content on this website is dedicated to
        documenting the development of the personal website & weblog service.
    - The website is completely open-source, and all the source code is
        available on [GitHub](www.github.com/icarlthiscode/).
- You can follow my long-form content via the
    [weblog](https://carledwardlyons.ca/weblog).
    - My [personal website](https://carledwardlyons.ca) itself acts as a curated
        landing page for all my projects.
    - My first weblog post,
        [Hello World](https://carledwardlyons.ca/weblo/hello-world), is a
        natural introduction to my content.
    - You can also explore my articles & portfolio freely using the article
        [index](https://carledwardlyons.ca/articles).

### *Ad Infinitum*
- I am also continuously adding to two intertwined content series:
    - The first is
        [Planning a Software Project](/outlines/planning-a-software-project)
        - This series is a collection of articles explores the basic concepts
            of software architecture & design.
        - As part of this series, I am exploring the process of planning &
            executing the development of this website & weblog as a case study.
    - Additionally, I am documenting the entire process of my
        [Personal Website Development](/outlines/personal-site-framework)
        in detail.
        - In this less formal devlog series, I am providing a step-by-step
            account of the development process.
        - Supplemented with the `git` commit history, this series is a
            comprehensive record & tutorial for the entire project.
- It is a personal aspiration to continue sharing my knowledge & experience.
    - Beyond these articles, I hope to continue writing about science,
        technology, and education.
    - I believe that sharing knowledge is a powerful way to contribute to the
        community and empower others.

## The Sandcastle
- The most significant motivation for building this entire website myself is the
    ultimate freedom it provides.
    - As a software developer, using other developers' solutions would be a
        missed opportunity to showcase my skills.
    - I have complete control over the design, content, and functionality of the
        website.
    - I can experiment with new ideas, technologies, and design patterns without
        being constrained by the limitations of third-party solutions.
- While the building and maintaining this project will be painstaking
    & unending, it is a labour of love.
    - Building software has quickly become my favourite preoccupation.
    - Taking the time to craft each detail of this project is a rewarding
        experience.
    - While not itself an impactful project, I hope my efforts can teach
        & inspire other creators.
